Hello, I'm a **robotics software engineer** at [Telexistence Inc.](https://tx-inc.com/en/home/), a company that builds robots for restocking beverages at convenience stores. Last year in 2022, we started deploying robots at 300 FamilyMart stores ([press release](https://tx-inc.com/en/blog/2022/08/10/11737/)).

I'm part of the Automation Team that works on **motion planning, computer vision, and system integration**. My specific responsibilities include:
- adding new and maintaining existing functionality of motion planning modules
- providing support in integrating computer vision modules
- creating and maintaining docs on software development and robot deployment in stores

I completed my **Master's in Robotics** from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) in 2018 and shortly after moved to Japan.

I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my robotics toolbox by working on a variety of engineering problems/requirements. Please feel free to reach out.



Interests
------
- **Manipulation**: make a robot with arms perform activities intelligently
- **Navigation**: help a robot move about in an environment with static/dynamic obstacles

Given how interdisciplinary robotics is and the various challenging and fun problems to be worked on, it's hard to stay locked in just one area. Wherever the action is happening, I want in!

Go ahead and check out my [projects](/portfolio/)!
