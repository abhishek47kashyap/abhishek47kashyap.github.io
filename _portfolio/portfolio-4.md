This page shows my work from my participation in the Assembly track of the [ICRA 2023 Virtual Manipulation Challenge](https://www.sim4dexterity.de/en/icra-2023-competition/competition-assembly.html). This task had 3 difficulty levels, more information on which can be found [here](https://github.com/DavidPL1/assembly_example/wiki/screwing).

Objective: `screw` has to be screwed into the `nut` after placing `nut` on the `fixture`

Here's my solution for difficulty level 2 at 10x speed:
