Since all IP is owned by [Molcure Inc.](https://molcure.com/), I can only share limited information. Majority of my work involved working with:
- **Robot Operation System (ROS)**: involved bidirectional communication between the robots and the user interface
- **Firmware**: received instructions from ROS and executed them on the robots

Visit [this page](https://molcure.com/haive-en/) for more information on the parallel robots.
